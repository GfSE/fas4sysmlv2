1 INTRODUCTION
==============

The FAS plugin for SysML v2 can create a functional architecture model from 
a specification of use case activities, following the FAS method [1,2,3].

The underlying version of the SysML v2 specification is a working copy that was 
obtained from  https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release/tree/master/doc
by the time of writing this version of the FAS Plugin for SysML v2. It is
thus a good prediction of a potential future SysML v2 standard, but not yet
a standardized specification. 

The FAS Plugin for SysML v2 will use the "FAS-as-a-formula" approach [4] to transform
Use Case Activities into Functional Architecture.

This document describes its installation and use.

2 INSTALLATION
==============

The following procedure should work on Windows 10 and 11 as well as on some 
Linux distributions (tested with the OpenSUSE Leap 15.4 distribution).

 - Install the SysML 2 reference installation for jupyter, according to
   https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release/tree/master/install/jupyter
   (Note that this will also ensure the installation of Miniconda3 incl. Python.
   The minimum required Python version is Python 3.9)

 - Ensure that the "sympy" package for Python is installed
   (it can be installed from a command prompt with the command "pip install sympy").

 - Extract the folder structure of the FAS plugin, from the distribution containing
   the present document.

 - Ensure that you have access to a pilot implementation of a SysML v2 repository.
   The SysML v2 reference implementation for jupyter must be set up to use this repository.
   The installation of your own SysML v2 repository pilot installation is described here:
   https://github.com/GfSE/fas4sysmlv2/blob/main/doc/tech-docs/sysmlv2-pilot/installation_howto.odt
   The above guide also specifies how to define the repository to be used by the SysML v2 
   reference implementation.

 - Ensure that OpenOffice or LibreOffice is installed


3 USE
=====

 - In the extracted folder structure, open the folder containing the file "fas_frontend.odp"
   and open that file in OpenOffice or LibreOffice.

 - Follow the instructions that are provided on the "How to run" slide in that slide deck.
